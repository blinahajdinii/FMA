            <section>I created a project dedicated to my <abbr title="Yll Limani">favorite singer</abbr>, showcasing
                their biography, achievements, and
                most popular songs. Using HTML, I designed a visually appealing webpage that includes images, a
                brief timeline of their career, and embedded videos of their performances. This project reflects my
                ability to organize and present information creatively while utilizing the skills Iâ€™ve gained in
                HTML.</section>

                <p>I worked on a networking project using Cisco Packet Tracer to design and simulate a small office
                    network. The setup included multiple VLANs for different departments, configured with routers,
                    switches, and PCs. I implemented IP addressing, inter-VLAN routing, and tested connectivity between
                    devices to ensure seamless communication. This project enhanced my understanding of network design,
                    troubleshooting, and the practical application of subnetting and VLANs in real-world scenarios.</p>
