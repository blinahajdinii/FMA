            <section>I created a project dedicated to my favorite singer, showcasing their biography, achievements, and
                most popular songs. Using HTML, I designed a visually appealing webpage that includes images, a
                brief timeline of their career, and embedded videos of their performances. This project reflects my
                ability to organize and present information creatively while utilizing the skills I’ve gained in
