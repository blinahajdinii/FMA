    <p>Friendship is one of life’s greatest treasures. True friends offer support, understanding, and joy through life’s
        ups and downs. They celebrate your successes and comfort you in tough times. Building strong friendships
        requires trust, communication, and effort, but the connections formed can create lasting memories and a sense of
        belonging that enriches life.
